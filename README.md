## The Mission

I specialize in building and automating the defenses of the modern software lifecycle. My goal is to integrate security seamlessly into the development pipeline, turning potential vulnerabilities into secure, repeatable processes. Think of me as a digital architect who ensures the walls are strong and the alarms are always on.
